All about clickTime !

### Stopwatches
As many as the device can support, for each one give a name, a length of lap if any. Start and let it run as long
as  wanted, take partial clickTime. If a length is defined you can have the average speed for each lap.<br>
Alternatively you can define partial length before start and the clickTime each "leg" and get speed on each.<br>
Last you can use a stopwatch as a kind of super Timer by defining times before start and get a notification(see Timer)
once predefined times are reached.
