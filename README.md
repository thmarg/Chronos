All about time !

### Stopwatches
As many as the device can support, for each one give a name, a lenght of lap if any. Start and let it run as long 
as  wanted, take partial time. If a lenght is defined you can have the average speed for each lap.<br>
Alternatively you can define partial lenght before start and the time each "leg" and get speed on each.<br>
Last you can use a stopwatch as a kind of super Timer by defining times before start and get a notification(see Timer)
once predefined times are reached.
